          Unlike most validators relying on cloud infrastructure, SwissStake
          operates on a dedicated physical server.

        <p>This approach ensures:</p>

        <h2>Independence</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            We're not tied to any third-party policies, giving us the
            flexibility to adapt and innovate.
          </p>
          <h2>Control</h2>
          <p>
            Complete control over the hardware means optimal performance and
            security.
          </p>
          <h2>Reliability</h2>
          <p>
            Our bare metal machine minimizes potential downtime and maximizes
            efficiency.
